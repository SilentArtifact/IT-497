# IT-497
There are only two files for this assignment, rawData.csv, which is the raw data downloaded from the Rotten Tomatoes API, and OSEMN.Rnw, which is the raw R code to generate the report. 

As of the evening of the 4/14/15, it compiled to PDF without issue, but on connecting the workspace to github, render_listings stopped working for reasons I still, as of writing this, cannot comprehend. The code executes properly and without issue, but it will not compile to PDF happily anymore. I hope that this is an issue with my environment, and not the code.
